#  Voltron Bot About/Help Sheet
## Introductory
This page was created to help familiarize people with the Discord Bot, Voltron, and how to use its different commands. 

## Features
Currently the robot automatically connects to the server, and DMs any new users added while the bot is active.
The terminal will recieve various pieces of information on the channel the bot has joined, including name of the server, the owner of the server, and a few other details.

## Command List
### Each command must be used with the prefix '$', so the bot will recognize the message as a command.
### (Parentheses show what information, if any, to give to a command (Brackets mean that that argument is not required by the command.))
 - makechannel (makechannel [channel]) -> creates a channel
 - translate (translate msg [lang]) -> translates the message to the specified language, defaults to French.
 - ban_word (ban_word word) -> adds a word to the server's current list of banned words.
